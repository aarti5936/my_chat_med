Question,Expected Answer
What is an accessory organ?,A lump of tissue adjacent to an organ that is similar but serves no important purpose.
Can an accessory organ become harmful?,"Yes, if it grows too large or becomes cancerous."
What does 'benign' mean in medical terms?,"It describes an abnormal growth that is stable, treatable, and generally not life-threatening."
What is a biopsy?,The surgical removal and analysis of a tissue sample for diagnostic purposes.
What is a calculus in medical terms?,"A hard concretion (stone) in the body, usually found in the gallbladder, pancreas, or kidneys."
How do calculi form?,They form by the accumulation of excess mineral salts and other organic materials.
What is cirrhosis?,A chronic liver disease characterized by abnormal fibrous growths and reduced liver function.
What are common causes of cirrhosis?,"Alcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis, and congestive heart disease."
What is the function of the common bile duct?,It transports bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine.
What is a CT scan?,A specialized x-ray imaging technique that produces detailed two-dimensional images of soft tissues.
Why are CT scans used?,"To provide detailed imaging of soft tissues, especially the brain."
What is the Doppler effect?,The change in frequency of sound wave echoes from a moving object.
How does the Doppler effect apply in medicine?,It helps measure blood flow in arteries and veins.
What is sound frequency?,The number of vibrations per second of a sound wave.
How does frequency affect sound?,Higher frequency results in a higher pitch.
What is ionizing radiation?,Radiation that can damage living tissue by disrupting individual cells at the molecular level.
Which types of radiation are ionizing?,"X-rays, gamma rays, and beta rays."
What is jaundice?,"A condition that results in a yellow tint to the skin, eyes, and body fluids due to bile retention."
What causes jaundice?,"Obstruction of the bile duct, liver disease, or pancreatic cancer."
What does 'malignant' mean?,Growing worse and resisting treatment
What is morphology in medicine?,"The study of the size, shape, and structure of organs rather than their function."
